## What are we?

Hollar is an all-in-one social media and networking application available on both iOS and Android. We allow our users to create a condensed personal profile that combines both social (i.e. Instagram, Twitter, etc.) and professional (i.e. LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.) profiles. These profiles can be written to NFC (Near-Field Communication) tags, allowing users to seamlessely connect with each other with a tap of their phone to one of these tags. Users' connections will appear in their searchable "Rolodex".
